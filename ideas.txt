    - is "fseek(fptr, -1, SEEK_CUR)" eqvt to "fptr--" ??
        - and is it faster
    - does fread() move the fptr if it fails?
    - if so, is there any reason to ftell() before comparing i == fptrOffset . sizeof(unsigned char)
    - using ascii as i in do-while() -- make sure errors arent possible
        from not checking condition before first iteration

    - linked list part is O(n) for having it in order by frequency
    - try this with a tree and see if its better
        - would have to make a tree concurrently from inside tree #1

    - if arrays past a certain size are slower than fwrite() and fread()
        between functions then youre faggint it
    - with the whole linked list scheme for storing code path,
        investigate what the next fields are left as after their initial use
        - if they were set to NULL already, they may/may not have needed to be
